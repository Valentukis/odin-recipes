    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This refreshing drink made by your babushka is a must. If you don't like it, you don't have taste.</p>
    <p>Still not sure? No one asked. Just go and make it already.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fruit</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Wash fruits, and pit any stone fruit that you’re using.</li>
        <li>Fill a pot with water, and bring it to a boil.
            Add fruit, and cook uncovered for 5-7 minutes.
            Switch the heat off, and add sugar to taste. Let the sugar dissolve.</li>
        <li>Let the juice come to room temperature, and then either strain it or not (we don’t!).
            Serve the juice warm (during winter), or chilled!</li>
    </ol>
